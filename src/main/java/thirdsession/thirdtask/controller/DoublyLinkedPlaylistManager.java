/**
 * The DoublyLinkedPlaylistManager class manages a playlist of songs using a doubly linked list structure.
 * This class allows for efficient addition, removal, and navigation of songs in the playlist.
 * Each song is represented by a Node, which contains links to both the next and previous songs,
 * enabling traversal in both directions. The class provides methods to add songs to the playlist,
 * remove songs by index, display all songs, and navigate through the playlist. It also maintains
 * the current song being played, allowing users to easily move to the next or previous song in the list.
